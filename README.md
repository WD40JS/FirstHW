Challenging homework assignment meant to improve capabilities. 
This was an attempt at reducing the lines of code to further optimise speed and ease of use for those behind me.
CSS was reduced from approximately 200 lines of code to approximately 140 lines. 
HTML wasn't changed musch due to its instability when I tried to do so.
CSS elements weren't applied when too much was changed in the HTML.
I surmise that the CSS and HTML elements lacked resonance when changed to being more semantic.
I will further improve on my technique as to resolve this whilst still maintianing site stability.
